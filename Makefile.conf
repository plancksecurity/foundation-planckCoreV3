# See `doc/build-<your platform>.md` for documentation on how to build, and customize your build.

# This file sets all the make variables that allow you to customize a build.
# There are 3 ways in which you can customize your build:
# 1) Edit the variable assignments in this file (this is a tracked file, so your repository will be dirty)
# 2) Create `local.conf` and fill it with variable assignments.
# 3) Set the environment variable `BUILD_CONFIG` to an absolute path.
#    The variable assignments found in the make file at the path indicated by `BUILD_CONFIG` will be evaluated.
# Customization options are applied in the order given above. Later variable assignments take precedence over earlier ones.
# It is possible to use multiple variants simultaniously.
# If nothing is changed according to these 3 methods, a default configuration for your platform (specified below) will be used for the build.
