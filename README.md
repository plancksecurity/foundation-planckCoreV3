# What is the p≡p Engine?
The p≡p Engine is a Free Software library encapsulating implementations of:

- Key Management

  The p≡p Engine automatically manages keys using a pluggable crypto backend.  The currently implemented backend is based on [Sequoia PGP](https://sequoia-pgp.org), and uses OpenPGP-format keys.

  p≡p for Email is interoperable with OpenPGP.

- Trust Rating

  The p≡p Engine sports a two phase trust rating system for messages:
  In phase one a rating is derived based on channel, crypto and key security.
  This is named "comm_types".
  In phase two these ratings are mapped to user-representable values mimicking the semantics of a traffic light.

- Abstract Crypto API

  The Abstract Crypto API provides functions to encrypt and decrypt data or full messages, without requiring an application programmer to understand the different applied formats and standards.

- Message Transports

  The p≡p Engine will sport a growing list of message transports, to support any widespread text-based messaging system such as E-Mail, SMS, XMPP and many more.

The p≡p Engine is written in C17 and is expected to run on any platform that conforms to the SUS/POSIX specification.
Selected non-SUS platforms are supported as well (such as Microsoft Windows).

# How can I use the p≡p Engine?
The official build instructions can be found at the URL
  https://dev.pep.foundation/Adapter/Adapter%20Build%20Instructions_Version_3.x_DRAFT
The p≡p Engine is not meant to be used in application code directly.
Instead, the p≡p Engine is meant to be used in conjunction with a so-called "adapter".
An adapter provides an API in a programming language that best accomodates developers in their respective software development ecosystem.
So, for example, a Java Native Interface adapter exists for development of apps for the Android mobile operating system, or a .NET adapter exists for development of applications on Microsoft Windows.
Various adapters are also available at the link provided for the p≡p Engine's code above.

# What is the current state of the project?
The p≡p Engine is production-ready.
It is under active development by several full-time employees of the p≡p foundation and its partner organizations.
The most recent version of the source code can be obtained here: <https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/>.
This is the only offical way to obtain a copy of the source code.

# I would like to contribute to the p≡p Engine or a related project, where do I start?
First of all, excellent! You can find further information here: <https://contribution.pep.foundation/>
