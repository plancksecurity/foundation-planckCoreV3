/* Exponential backoff.
 * ***************************************************************** */

/* This facility implements an exponential backoff variant.  The main intended
   application is concurrent execution of SQLite statements, which are subject
   to fail with SQLITE_BUSY or SQLITE_LOCKED and need to be retried in a loop.
   Backing off before trying again makes such loops less CPU-intensive, and
   should lead to faster eventual progress.

   The constant definitions below could be in theory tuned in application-,
   platform- and even machine-specific ways.  Here the intent is simply
   sustaining a moderate amount of threads, in the order of a few tens, all
   concurrently writing to the same database.
   The pEp Engine appears to be unusual among database applications for its high
   number of write operations; the reason might be update_identity. */

/* This facility provides a convenient way to execute C statement performing
   SQLite database actions, automatically retrying as necessary, with an
   exonential backoff, until the sql status code becomes different from
   SQLITE_LOCKED and SQLITE_BUSY.

   The facility defined here can be used with any database connection, and
   does not rely on EXCLUSIVE transactions.  For a different facility
   implementing exclusivity by spinlocking (with exponential backoff) see
   the section below. */

/* PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP, PEP_SQL_END_LOOP: expand to a C statement executing
   SQLite statements in a loop until the result is no longer SQLITE_BUSY.
   The user should write her C code containing SQLite statements to be repeated
   within a single scope delimited by a call to PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and a call to
   PEP_SQL_END_LOOP .  For example:
      int sqlite_status;
      PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP(sqlite_status);
      sqlite_status = sqlite3_exec(db, "INSERT INTO Foo (foo) VALUES (42);",
                                   NULL, NULL, NULL);
      PEP_SQL_END_LOOP();
   At run time the statements surrounded by the two macros will be repeated
   until the SQLite status referred as an lvalue in PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP is
   different from SQLITE_BUSY.  After each failure with SQLITE_BUSY release the
   CPU for a random time according to an exponential backoff policy.
   After the expansion of PEP_SQL_END_LOOP it is guaranteed that the status will
   be different from SQLITE_BUSY -- even if it might still be an error state.
   Macro calls to PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and PEP_SQL_END_LOOP *must* be paired as
   shown above: calling only one of them, or calling them both in different
   scopes, may expend to invalid code and has undefined behaviour even when the
   expansion happened to be syntactically valid.
   It is possible to nest paired macro calls to PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and
   PEP_SQL_END_LOOP , even if this is probably unnecessary. */

/* SQLite EXCLUSIVE transactions and spinlocking
 * ***************************************************************** */

/* The facility defined in this section uses the macros above to implement
   "BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION" and "COMMIT TRANSACTION" / "ROLLBACK
   TRANSACTION" forms which are guaranteed to hide any problem with
   SQLITE_BUSY: once an exclusive transaction is succesfully begun it is
   guaranteed that any SQL statement over the same database will *not* fail
   with SQLITE_BUSY over the current connection, but *will* instead fail with
   SQLITE_BUSY over any other connection.
   In other words beginning a transaction with this facility acquires an
   exclusive lock, to be only released at transaction end.
   The pEp Engine was originally written without giving much thought to the
   problem of SQL concurrency; adopting this simple-minded solution is a good
   way to make existing code robust without modifying it to roll back the C
   state every time a retry is needed -- which would be very difficult to do
   correctly.
   This facility is only defined for use with the management database.  Of
   course it could be factored and generalised.

   This is a higher-level facility defined on top of the facility above
   (beginning an exclusive transaction requires a loop), useful in non-trivial
   tranasctions where more than one SQL statement needs to be executed.

   Differently from PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and PEP_SQL_END_LOOP the macros defined
   here do not need to be paired syntactically: however ending a transaction
   via commiting or rolling back is necessary to release the lock. */
