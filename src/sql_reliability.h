/* Exponential backoff.
 * ***************************************************************** */

/* This facility implements an exponential backoff variant.  The main intended
   application is concurrent execution of SQLite statements, which are subject
   to fail with SQLITE_BUSY or SQLITE_LOCKED and need to be retried in a loop.
   Backing off before trying again makes such loops less CPU-intensive, and
   should lead to faster eventual progress.

   The constant definitions below could be tuned in application-, platform- and
   even machine-specific ways.  Here the intent is simply sustaining a moderate
   amount of threads, in the order of a few hundreds, all concurrently writing
   to the same database, with a write bandwidth not too far from the sequential
   case.
   These values were tentatively set by positron in early 2023 by testing on his
   "moore" laptop (4-core 8-thread Intel i7 3.2GHz, 16GB RAM, SSD drive),
   GNU/Linux. */

/* This facility provides a convenient way to execute C statement performing

   does not rely on EXCLUSIVE transactions.  For a different facility
   implementing exclusivity by spinlocking (with exponential backoff) see
   the section below. */

/* PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP, PEP_SQL_END_LOOP: expand to a C statement executing
   SQLite statements in a loop until the result is no longer SQLITE_LOCKED or
   SQLITE_BUSY.
   The user should write her C code containing SQLite statements to be repeated
   within a single scope delimited by a call to PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and a call to
   PEP_SQL_END_LOOP .  For example:
      int sqlite_status = SQLITE_OK;
      PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP(sqlite_status);
      sqlite_status = sqlite3_exec(db, "INSERT INTO Foo (foo) VALUES (42);",
                                   NULL, NULL, NULL);
      PEP_SQL_END_LOOP();
   At run time the statements surrounded by the two macros will be repeated
   until the SQLite status referred as an lvalue in PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP is
   different from both SQLITE_LOCKED and SQLITE_BUSY.  After each failure with
   either SQLITE_LOCKED or SQLITE_BUSY release the CPU for a random time
   according to an exponential backoff policy.
   After the expansion of PEP_SQL_END_LOOP it is guaranteed that the status will
   be different from SQLITE_LOCKED and SQLITE_BUSY -- even if it might still be
   an error state.
   Macro calls to PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and PEP_SQL_END_LOOP *must* be paired as
   shown above: calling only one of them, or calling them both in different
   scopes, may expend to invalid code and has undefined behaviour even when the
   expansion happened to be syntactically valid.
   It is possible to nest paired macro calls to PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and
   PEP_SQL_END_LOOP , even if this is probably unnecessary. */

/* SQLite EXCLUSIVE transactions and spinlocking
 * ***************************************************************** */

/* The facility defined in this section uses the macros above to implement
   "BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION" and "COMMIT TRANSACTION" / "ROLLBACK
   TRANSACTION" forms which are guaranteed to hide any problem with
   SQLITE_LOCKED and SQLITE_BUSY: once an exclusive transaction is succesfully
   begun it is guaranteed that any SQL statement over the same database will
   *not* fail with SQLITE_LOCKED or SQLITE_BUSY over the current connection,
   but *will* instead fail with SQLITE_LOCKED or SQLITE_BUSY over any other
   connection.
   In other words beginning a transaction with this facility acquires an
   exclusive lock, to be only released at transaction end.
   The pEp Engine was originally written without giving much thought to the
   problem of SQL concurrency; adopting this simple-minded solution is a good
   way to make existing code robust without modifying it to roll back the C
   state every time a retry is needed -- which would be very difficult to do
   correctly.
   This facility is only defined for use with the management database.  Of
   course it could be factored and generalised.

   This is a higher-level facility defined on top of the facility above
   (beginning an exclusive transaction requires a loop), useful in non-trivial
   tranasctions where more than one SQL statement needs to be executed.

   Differently from PEP_SQL_BEGIN_LOOP and PEP_SQL_END_LOOP the macros defined
   here do not need to be paired syntactically: however ending a transaction
   via commiting or rolling back is necessary to release the lock. */
