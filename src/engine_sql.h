/* In order to guarantee that concurrent accesses to the management database,
   possibly from multiple threads, happen correctly and without having failures
   inside transactions, we surround SQL statements with
     BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION;
     ...
     COMMIT TRANSACTION or ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
   The execution of BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION in C always happens in a loop
   that automatically retries until the lock is acquired.  This feature is
   implemented in sql_reliability.h .
   Acquiring the lock at the beginning of the exclusive transaction becomes the
   main contention point between threads.  Unfortunately there are cases in
   which acquiring the lock seems to loop forever, even if no other threads are
   racing.  As a last resort, after PEP_BACKOFF_TIMES_BEFORE_REFRESHING_DB
   consecutive failures to begin an exclusive transaction, we close and reopen
   the database connection, re-preparing every SQL statement.  After this
   "refresh" it becomes possible to begin an exclusive transaction again.
   This function implements refreshing.
   Notice that refreshing is only legitimate while the SQL statement we are
   failing to execute is BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION. */

   same function with the same session.
   In case of any error this still returns a valid non-empty string.

   There are multiple functions each extracting the SQL status from a different
   place:
   - directly a parameter
   - the current state of the management database connection in the session. */
