v3.2.0  2023-03-23
* CI fixes, thanks to dvn:
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/pulls/147 .
* Update the API specification in api/ so that we can machine-generate more
  code.  Not finished yet, but this might help concurrent development such as
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/149 .
* Solve a benign but distracting intermittent test suite failure, that happens
  on the CI machine but not on positron's laptop.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/150 .

v3.2.0-RC27  2023-03-16
* Fix management database upgrading from versions older than 13; no API changes.
* Fix benign test suite failures: we are back to zero expected failures.

v3.2.0-RC26  2023-03-03
* Merge https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/139 from
  Dirk: build system updates, after I added a new compilation unit.

v3.2.0-RC25  2023-03-01
* Merge https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/pulls/138 (build
  fixes for ios, thanks to Dirk).
* New environment variable PEP_LOG_ASYNC: when defined (to any value) make
  database-destination logging asynchronous, which is less reliable in case of
  crashes but faster by several orders of magnitide.
  New API function to control the same feature at configuration level, per
  session:
  DYNAMIC_API void config_enable_log_synchronous(PEP_SESSION session, bool enable);
* Fix API function get_crashdump_log: it is now back to work correctly if
  logging is enabled with a database destination; otherwise, return a status
  different from PEP_STATUS_OK.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/91 .
* Update YML2 dependency (reported by Dvn).
* Release builds of the Engine are now compiled (on platforms using make)
  without debugging symbols, in order to work around
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/115 .

v3.2.0-RC24  2023-02-20
* log the current thread id along with the current process id.  When stuck on
  a backoff loop write a log line once every PEP_BACKOFF_TIMES_BEFORE_LOGGING
  failed attempts.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/136 .

v3.2.0-RC23  2023-02-09
* some documentation updates: link build instructions from README.md .
* improve logging, in particular making it very visible when we discover that a
  key expired or was revoked.
* Give the asn en/de-coders a much bigger stack size by patching asn_internal.h
  .  This is a direct fix (thanks to Dirk) of a problem presumably already
  solved by rate-limitation; building with sanitisers on ios should now be
  convenient again.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/97 .
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/98 .
* Build system fixes to compile on Windows, contributed by Alex Sualdea and Jörg
  Knobloch.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/123 .
* Incompatible API change: remove unused obj parameters from API functions
  do_sync_protocol and do_sync_protocol_step ; this change is easy to adjust to
  but will break every adapter.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/126 .

v3.2.0-RC22  2023-02-01
* New API function PEP_STATUS_is_error.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/111 .
* Avoid the use of #warning, not supported by the microsoft compiler.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/122 .

v3.2.0-RC21  2023-02-01
* DEPENDENCIES: use the new pEpEngineSequoiaBackend release; this includes some
  build system improvements to which we Engine people contributed, making
  pEpEngineSequoiaBackend easy to install with make following the pEp
  conventions.
* local.conf.example: in order to build the Engine in safety mode 'release' the
  DEBUG variable must now be defined as 'release', instead of being set to be
  empty.
* bug fix: actually keep into account the safety mode to determine the Engine
  compiler flags, so that optimisation and the presence debugging symbols  can
  be controlled.
  Now default to *always* compiling with debugging symbols; however this new
  behaviour can be overridden...
* local.conf.example: ...with new user-overridable variable
  COMPILEWITHDEBUGGINGSYMBOLS , which lets the user decide whether the Engine is
  compiled with the -g (or equivalent) option.
* Build system: PER_MACHINE_DIRECTORY: change the default value to use PREFIX.
  I suspect the previous default was not used much.
* Add cute banner shown when invoking make.
* Fix zero-argument C function prototypes and definitions so as to use (void)
  rather than ().  This is the correct solution and the fix prevents huge
  volumes of distracting warnings from some compilers (reported by heck with
  least apple clang 14).
  This fixes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/113 .
* Fix https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/118 in 3.x as
  well by adding a test case documenting the behaviour difference; the
  unexpected ugly status code was only returned in 2.x, which required a
  non-trivial fix.
* If the environment variable PEP_NOABORT is defined, to any value, never abort
  on failure indepdendently from the fatality mode.  This is meant for internal
  use with the pEp Engine test suite, but users and developers of other pEp
  components might also find this useful.
  This solves https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/121 .
* documentation: mention do_sync_protocol_init , previously forgottem, in the
  NEWS entry for v3.2.0-RC20 (2023-01-23).
* Fix https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/107 : no
  longer prematurely free identity list in update_identity.
* Echo: add pEp-auto-consume header.
  Closes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/96.

v3.2.0-RC20  2023-01-23
* make register_sync_callbacks really side-effect-free; this fixes
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/116 (Thanks to
  Heck.)  This contributes to unblock
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpJNIAdapter/issues/24 .
* In relation to the change above: new API function do_sync_protocol_init ,
  which initialises the Sync state machinery independently from
  register_sync_callbacks (which now *only* sets callback functions).
* undo recent Makefile changes related to Sequoia: a cleaner solution is
  forthcoming.

v3.2.0-RC19  2023-01-18
* The logging facility can now enabled and disabled from a configuration
  function, the new API function
    DYNAMIC_API void config_enable_log(PEP_SESSION session, bool enable)
  .  By default logging is now disabled, unless the environment variable PEP_LOG
  is defined to any value.
  This solves https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/100
* sql_reliability: remove debugging prints, replace with more generally useful
  messages.

v3.2.0-RC18  2023-01-18
* Fix https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/90 : it is
  now possible to open multiple concurrent threads with a database logging
  destination.
  No user-visible changes, other than more reliability.
* Make SQL transactions robust by not assuming, incorrectly, that COMMIT
  TRANSACTION or ROLLBACK TRANSACTION never fail with SQLITE_BUSY or
  SQLITE_LOCKED inside an EXCLUSIVE tranaction.  This improves
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/104
  with a fix in the same spirit of
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/90 .
  Again no user-visible changes, other than more reliability.

v3.2.0-RC17  2023-01-18
* general overhaul of concurrent SQL execution, adding loops with exponential
  backoff and EXCLUSIVE transactions.  This should solve many concurrency
  problems (see src/sql_reliability.h ).
  This fixes https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/104 .
  Even if this is an important change there is no API change related to this
  functionality.

v3.2.0-RC16  2023-01-17
* rewrite some CPP macros working around problems (I indeed suspect a bug:
  macro expansion contained parentheses not in macro definitions) with
  microsoft's compiler.  Reported by Alex, who helped testing my proposed
  redefinitions.  The current code is meant to work on every platform.

v3.2.0-RC15  2023-01-13
* move state machine initialisation out for callback registering.  This avoids
  that Sync beacon messages are sent at session initialisation (thanks to Volker
  Birk).
* Echo protocol: implement a rate limit on Ping and Pong messages to each
  destination identity, from each device.  This prevents flooding with Ping or
  Pong messages.
* update pEpEngineSequoiaBackend dependency: this in its turn will use a more
  recent sequoia-openpgp, which fixes a performance bug.
* update_pEp_user_trust_vals: fix and generalise my previous fix.

v3.2.0-RC14  2022-12-22
* Provide a local.conf.example .
* In local.conf.example explain how the DEBUG variable has changed behaviour
  in an incompatible way since Engine 3.2.0-RC13 .
* New API function stringpair_list_find_case_insensitive .
* When searching for message headers always compare names case-insensitively.
  This is an incompatibile change, but the previous behaviour was incorrect.
* bug fix in set_as_pEp_user: do not hardwire the pEp protocol version to 2.1!
  The code doing that was particularly treacherous.  In order to prevent such
  errors in the future, introduce and use...
* PEP_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR, PEP_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR: ...New macros.
* PEP_VERSION is now only a deprecated alias for PEP_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
  automatically computed from the two macros above.
* Rename PEP_CANNOT_SET_PEP_VERSION to PEP_CANNOT_SET_PEP_PROTOCOL_VERSION; keep
  the old name as a compatibility alias
* PEP_enc_format: new case aliases PEP_enc_PEP_message_v1 and
  PEP_enc_PEP_message_v2; the numeric values have not changes.
* rating_to_string: add a case for PEP_rating_media_key_protected, fixing #94.
* fix windows compilation problem releated to strcasecmp; problem reported by
  Alex.  This fixes
  https://gitea.pep.foundation/pEp.foundation/pEpEngine/issues/109 .
* New protocol version 3.3.
  The only difference is the new handling of trustwords with RIPEMD-160.
* Unfortunately we have to disable backward compatibility by default to prevent
  downgrade attacks.
  Compatibility with older protocols requiring xor trustwords is kept if the
  Engine is built with the CPP macro
  PEP_TRUSTWORDS_XOR_COMPATIBILITY defined.  This can be accomplished by adding
    -DPEP_TRUSTWORDS_XOR_COMPATIBILITY=1
  to the command line, or (when using our Makefile) by building with the make
  variable TRUSTWORDSXORCOMPATIBILITY defined.
  Explicitly calling get_xor_trustwords_for_fprs will always yield xor
  trustwords.
* A further incompatible change in xor trustwords, "[A_XOR_A]": combining an fpr
  with itself no longer returns the same fpr as the result.  In other words we
  no longer have a special case to force
    for every A  A xor A == A
  .  Instead I am switching to the correct alternative: now
    for every A  A xor A == 0
  .  The test suite used to explicitly check this case; I changed the test suite
  to agree with Mathematics.
  I significantly factored, rewrote and and cleand up the old trustword code in
  src/message_api.c .
* local.conf.example: document TRUSTWORDSXORCOMPATIBILITY.
* PUBLIC_API get_trustwords_for_fprs ranamed to
  get_xor_trustwords_for_fprs : this implements the old, weaker FPR combination
  which might be vulnerable to a collision attack
  (It is not possible to write a higher-level backwards-compatible function
  get_trustwords_for_fprs which decides the best algorithm: the two FPRs are
  not enough to decide which algorithm is needed)
* New PUBLIC_API:
  get_ripemd_trustwords_for_fprs : this implement the new, stronger FPR
  combination
* The following PUBLIC_API functions have a new behaviour but the same API:
  * get_trustwords (taking identity arguments)
  * get_message_trustwords (taking a message and a recipient identity)
  In case xor-trustwords-compatibility is disabled these function now return
  PEP_TRUSTWORD_NOT_FOUND (instead of mismatching trustwords) when refusing to
  downgrade.
* Bug fix: update the pEp protocol version supported by a communication partner
  on successful decrpyption of a message from her (including on PEP_UNENCRYPTED);
  I believe that this behaviour had always been intended.
* add a THANKS file

v3.2.0-RC13  (not announced)
* add NEWS file
* add release script (for the Engine maintainer): the Engine version is now in a
  machine-generated file src/pEpEngine_version.h
* Merge pull request 'PEMA-41 Make the ObjC adapterbuild for iOS agains the
  latest engine (master/v3.2.0-RC11)' (#92) from dirk/pEpEngine:PEMA-41 into
  master

v3.2.0-RC12  2022-11-22
* handle_pong: fix bug preventing notification from being called, reported by
  Alex Sualdea
* Merge pull request 'PEMA-103-hotfix' (#88) from
  TSaschabc/pEpEngine:PEMA-103-hotfix into master
* Update sqlite amalgamation to 3.40.0

v3.2.0-RC11  2022-11-16
* add the new pEp_log functionality -- notice that some platform code is
  UNTESTED; I am waiting for feedback from platform maintainers;
* add the new pEp_debug functionality;
* convert existing code to use the new logging and debugging functionality;
* set_debug_color: remove DYNAMIC_API function.
* log_event, log_service, _service_error_log:  remove DYNAMIC_API functions,
  replaced by the new log functionality in src/pEp_log.h; I could re-implement
  the old functions based on the new API if people want that, but using the API

v3.2.0-RC10  2022-10-12
From this point on we consistently adopt the new naming scheme for tags: we
start the tag name with "v" instead of "Release_".
* fix compilation on windows (probably: untested).

Release_3.2.0-RC9  2022-10-12
* BUILD: Fix - Effectively add include and lib dir from local.conf' (#82)
* unfinished debug / log changes
* (broken on windows)

v3.2.0-RC8  2022-10-05
No complete change log for this RC, the first in the 3.x series to be actually
used.  The most important change from 2.x is Key-Election Removal; the list of
other changes (but not the changes themselves) is now lost.
Highligths:
* Switch from the old Sequoia-FFI to pEpEngineSequoiaBackend;
* Distribution.Echo protocol, ported from 2.x;
* Media keys, ported from 2.x;




This is a list of changes since Autumn 2022.  We did not formally keep track of
changes older than that, and in particular the changes from v2 to v3 are too
numerous to list.
Newer changes are at the top of this file.
